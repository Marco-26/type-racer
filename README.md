# type-racer
A simple type racer game made in JS.

# Overview
- This project is for training only. I've wanted to do this project in particular for a long time, but it was when a content creator I usually watch that decided to do a project similar to this, that I got the will to make myself a type racer.
- This game will look similar to a terminal and will also have features of calculating words per minute and user accuracy.
