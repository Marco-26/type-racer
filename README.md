# type-racer
Project Description:

This project is a type racer game built using JavaScript, which makes use of an API to retrieve texts that the player must type. The game is designed to test the player's typing speed and accuracy by presenting a given text for them to type as quickly and accurately as possible.

In addition to the core game mechanics, the project includes a planned feature to add a database using Firebase to store users' high scores. This feature will allow players to track their progress and compete with others on a global leaderboard.

The source code for this project is available on GitHub, where interested developers can explore the codebase and contribute to the project. The project leverages modern web technologies and follows best practices in software development, making it an excellent resource for those looking to learn and improve their skills.

Overall, this type racer game is a fun and engaging way to test and improve your typing skills while competing against others, and the planned addition of a Firebase database will take the game to the next level by allowing for long-term tracking of high scores and competition on a global scale.
